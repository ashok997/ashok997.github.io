I've always thought the time I spend scrolling the feeds of social media was a total waste of time ! Every day I would wake up and say to myself that I will spend less time and social media, then I would fail miserably at cutting the time and feel guilty. I would say “There it goes “x” hours of my life that I'm not getting back!!” Even though I have wasted numerous hours on my social media feed, I will always be thankful for that one post that led me to Flatiron School. Thanks to you Facebook, I'm now student @Flatiron. 

I've heard about Flatiron School back when I was living in NYC but I did not know that they have online classes. When, I came across the post about Flatiron School offering online classes I was curious. Soon, I found out, not only they offer online class but they offer it part time as well. It almost felt like it was a perfect opportunity to dive into the world of programming without being overwhelmed. And that's how my journey began at Flatiron!!The content of your blog post goes here.

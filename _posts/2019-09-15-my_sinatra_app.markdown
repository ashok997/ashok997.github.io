For the second portfolio project for Flatiron school, we were asked to build a sinatra application using *ActiveRecord* .  At the beginning of the project, I had an scattergun moment and couldn't decide what to do for the project. Finally, I settled for a simple app that keep track of all the items that the user is trying to sell on his/her online stores.

Most online seller now a days do not limit themselves to a single selling platform. They might have a store in amazon, ebay, etsy, shopify etc. Having a multiple platform is great but it also come with a challenge of keeping track of all of them. Its hard to track which items are listed in which platform and there might be some that you forgot to list completely.
My app is an attempt to solve that very problem. 

Once you sign up in the app, you can create a product, edit it and delete it too. You can also see what other users have in their stores and see details of those products too. You can't, however, edit or delete product created by other users.

One of the problem I faced during this project was that of scale. I thinking this project through the lens of the user for the long time so I had planned it with more details and features. Once, I pitched the idea to my cohort's technical coach, he reminded me that while the idea was great but we had limited time to finish the project. So, I had to strip it down to fit my time frame.  If I have time lot of free time in the coming days, I would like to continue working on this app and make it more useful for the online business community.

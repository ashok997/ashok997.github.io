 For the third project for the flatiron school, I decided to create Activation Tracker. Imagine you own an store-front where you sell and activate cell-phones for different carriers. This application will allow users to create and keep track of all the phones that they have in their store and also records all the activations they have completed. The idea of the project came to me because that what I do at work. 
 
 The major challenge for this project was to knowing where to start from and which direction to proceed. In general, even a simple rails project have so many moving parts, we have models, views, controllers etc to name few. I was trying to understand and figure everything to out before I start coding a single line of code, but pretty soon I found out , it was nearly impossible. I had to accept the fact that only way to tackle this kind of project was to do incrementally. So, even though I had no idea how I was going to several parts of the project, I had to start and build up from there. Yes, it does help a lot to have some general idea of what you are trying to achieve and its especially helpful to you have all your models and associations figured out but rest of the project had to be done in little increments. 
 
 Rails is very helpful for incremental development, beacuse of the built in error handling. For example if you are trying to get to the page and the route is missing, Rails will let you know.
 ```
 "No route matches [GET] "/users/new"
 ```
 My biggest lesson from this project may not be very technial but more behaviorial. I learned that it might seem scary sometimes to dive into coding while you're still trying to figure how to get the end result. In the case of rails project it may not be a bad idea to start coding anyway!!

I have finally finished my final project. I started this project 3 weeks ago and 3 weeks seems a lifetime ago now. It feels like we are living in the different world than we were few weeks ago. It definitely was a challenge to focus on the project during this crazy time but somehow I have manged to do that.

For my final project, I've decided to do something fun and I idea of this project came from my love of comic book superheroes. I decided to use marvel api for the project and build the page where users can search for their favourite characters and they can either upvote, downvote or comments on the characters. 

Before starting the project, I thought I would have most challenging time communicating with the API. This was the first time I had build anything using the external API. So, I used little time designing my backend and frontend before I started coding. But, to my surprise, working with the API wasn't that much difficult. Since, I had not thought much about my backend, halfway into my project I had to change my approach to how was saving all the characters information on to my backend. It was a really frustrating but my cohert technical coach helped me a lot. Coming in to the project, concept of Redux was very fuzzy but struggling and debugging for couple weeks have give me better understand of Redux. I am excited and anxious at the same time!!

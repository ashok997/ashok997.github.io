For the fourth project I've built a single page application that can help the users track the payments they have made on their credit card. In the current state a users can create a card and then they can record payments made on that particular credit card. Its a single page application built with Rails on back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.

Out of all the projects I've done, this has definitely been the most time consuming. I had trouble debugging whenever I had issues with my code. It is usually very difficult to allocate time to develop something that we have never done before. So, when I allocated few days for finishing this project, I missed my deadline. So, one of the big lesson of finishing this project would be about time management. For future projects, I would allow more time than my estimate. Then, even with some issues I can finish my project within deadline.

As of now, the project meet the minimum requirement of the guidelines, but, in future I would like to add some features like deleting the card, updating the cards and add multiple users.
